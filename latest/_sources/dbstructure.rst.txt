Data Organization
=================

The Databank includes three types of objects: Simulation, Experiment, and Molecule. Each is described by it's own metadata file. Metadata is stored in YAML format. Simulation object stores precomputed properties in JSON format. Experiment object stores experimental data in JSON format.

Databank objects are stored in the separated repository; by default, it's a `BilayerData <https://github.com/NMRlipids/BilayerData>`_ but any of its forks or even completely new repo could be used instead.
It is connected into the NMRlipids Databank repository as a submodule into :file:`./Data` folder.

Simulation record
-----------------

Simulation metadata README.yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A file containing all the relevant information of each simulation entry. These files are stored at :py:data:`Scripts.DatabankLib.NMLDB_SIMU_PATH`.

For more information see :doc:`schemas/simulation_metadata`.

Simulation computed properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. :file:`apl.json` contains area per lipid (Å\ :sup:`2`) as a function of time (ps) for a simulation. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeAPL` for computing details.



2. :file:`POPC_OrderParameters.json` contains C-H bond order parameters and their uncertainties.
Key in json format gives the universal C and H atom names.
Values are average over lipids, standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean, respectively. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeOP` for computing details.

3. :file:`FormFactor.json` contains simulated X-ray scattering form factor.
X-axis value unit are Å\ :sup:`-1` and y-axis value units are e/nm\ :sup:`2`. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeFF` for computing details.

4. :file:`XXXXDensity.json` contains electron densities calculated from trajectory.
We store separately lipid, water, and total densities.
X-axis units are nm and y-axis units e/nm\ :sup:`3`. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeFF` for computing details.

5. :file:`thickness.json` contains thickness (nm) calculated from the trajectory. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeThickness` for computing details.

6. :file:`eq_times.json` contains a dictionary with relative equilibration time of molecule principal components. It demonstrates how long time is required in this particular simulation to sample the ensemble for each lipid molecule. |br|
See :py:func:`Scripts.DatabankLib.analyze.computeNMRPCA` for computing details.

Simulation quality files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. :file:`POPC_OrderParameters_quality.json` contains a dictionary with the quality of each C-H bond against experiments if available. First key is the DOI for the source of experimental data. Second key gives C-H pair univeral atom names. Third key gives values for simulation order parameter, its stardard deviation, standard error of the mean, experimental order parameter, its error, and finally the quality of the order parameter. Quality is the probability for the agreement between simulated and experimental values taking into account the error bars.

For more details, see the `NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z>`_.

2. :file:`POPC_FragmentQuality.json` contains fragment qualities determined separately for each lipid in the simulation with experimental data available using Eq. (4) in the `NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z>`_.

3. :file:`SYSTEM_quality.json` contains total qualities averaged over different lipids for different membrane parts calculated from Eq. (5) in the `NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z>`_.

4. :file:`FormFactorQuality.json` contains quality of form factor against experimental data determined as described in the `NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z>`_. Second term is the scaling coefficient for experimental intensities (Eq. (6) in the `NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z>`_).

Experiment record

Molecule record
---------------

Molecule metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO: write the block

Mapping files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Describe connection between universal atom names and simulation specific atom names. These enable automatic analyses over simulations with different naming conventions. For more information, see :ref:`molecule_names`

Other files
-----------

.. _info_files:

info.yaml
~~~~~~~~~
Contains information given by contributor when adding data into the NMRlipids databank, i.e. all non-recomputable fields of simulation ``README.yaml``. This file is given as an input to :py:data:`Scripts.BuildDatabank.AddData` to create ``README.yaml`` files: :code:`python3 AddData.py -f info.yaml`. These files are not required but currently are stored historically in ``info_files`` subfolder of :py:data:`Scripts.DatabankLib.NMLDB_DATA_PATH`.

For more information see :ref:`readmesimu` and :ref:`addSimulation`.
