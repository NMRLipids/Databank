Adding simulations
==================

Stepwise instructions to add simulation into the NMRlipids databank, run the basic analyses and perform
automatic quality evaluation are given here. The first three steps are a minimum requirements to add a simulation.
The first three steps can be performed using graphical GitHub interface.
To run the basic analyses and quality evaluation from steps 4 forward, you need to create a local fork of the `NMRlipids BilayerData git <https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/>`_.
Remember that data is plugged to the main Databank repo as a submodule.

#. Add trajectory and topology (tpr for Gromacs, pdb or corresponding to other programs) file into a `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_ repository.\
   If you want to use other repository than Zenodo, please do not hesitate to open an `GitHub issue <https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank/issues>`_ on this.

#. Create an ``info.yaml`` file containing the essential information on your simulation by filling the `template <https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank/blob/development/Scripts/BuildDatabank/info_files/info.yaml>`_ (**TODO: LINK DOESN'T WORK**).
   For instructions, see :ref:`readmesimu` and `examples <https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/tree/main/info_files>`_.
   Mapping files are described in  :ref:`molecule_names` and are located in the :ref:`molecule_record` inside the folder of corresponding molecule.

#. You can store the created ``info.yaml`` file somewhere inside `./info_files/ <https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/tree/main/info_files>`_ folder in the BilayerData git and make a pull request to the main branch. **You can stop here or continue to create ``README.yaml`` file in step 4.**

#. Before continuing, make sure that your ``Data`` submodule is switched to your own fork.
   To create the ``README.yaml`` file for the databank you should run :ref:`add_data_py` on your info-file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      path-to/AddData.py -f {path to the info.yaml file that you created} -w {working-directory}

   After this is finished, you should see a new folder in `./simulations <https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank/tree/main/Data/Simulations>`_ which contains the ``README.yaml`` file of your system.
   Commit the created ``README.yaml`` file into the git.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add Simulations/**/README.yaml

#. To perform basic analyses for the added system(s) you should run :ref:`compute_databank_py` with the following keys:

   .. code-block:: bash

      path-to/compute_databank.py --apl --nmrpca --ff --thickness \
         --OP --range *-0

   By default, your new-created system gets ID -1, -2, etc, so we run recomputing only
   on range from -inf to 0.
   After this, you should see the results in the same folder where ``README.yaml`` is located.
   The results files should be staged by running

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add Simulations/**/*.json

#. For the quality evaluation against experiments, the simulation needs to be first connected
   to the corresponding experimental data (if available) by running :ref:`search_databank_py`.
   This will add the ``EXPERIMENT`` dictionary into the ``README.yaml`` files.
   This dictionary defines the location of related experimental data in `./experiments <https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/tree/main/experiments>`_ folder.
   Then the quality evaluation can be then done by running :ref:`quality_evaluation_py`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      path-to/searchDATABANK.py
      path-to/QualityEvaluation.py

   The resulting qualities can be then added into the git by running

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add Simulations/**/README.yaml
      git add Simulations/**/*.json

   To create rankings of simulations based on their quality against experiments and to store the results in folder `Data/Ranking <https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/tree/main/Ranking>`_, run

   .. code-block:: bash

      path-to/makeRanking.py
      git add Ranking/*.json

#. Finally, commit the added data into your fork and make a pull request into the main branch.
