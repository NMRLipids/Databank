This is the NMRlipids databank &mdash; a community-driven catalogue containing atomistic MD simulations of biologically relevant lipid membranes emerging from the [NMRlipids open collaboration](http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/2021/03/second-online-meeting-on-nmrlipids.html). 

# Installation

The code has been tested in Linux and MacOS environment with python 3.10 or newer. 
Recent [Gromacs](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/install-guide/index.html) version should be available in the system. 
All dependecies are listed in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

We recomend installing python libraries into an environment, for example, using conda:

```bash
conda create --name databank python==3.10 -c conda-forge
conda activate databank
```

Install *DatabankLib* package from repo:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NMRlipids/Databank
```

or from pypi:

```bash
pip install nmrlipids_databank
```

Note that the data is stored as a separated repository and should be loaded after cloning. 
Default data storage is [BilayerData](https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData).
You **MUST** specify `NMLDB_DATA_PATH` before start working. The easiest way to start is to use `nml_initialize_data` script provided with the package:

```bash
nml_initialize_data stable
source databank_env.rc
```

Then you can work with Databank's standalone scripts as well as use `DatabankLib` package in your python code.

# Documentation

The NMRlipids Databank project documentation is available in [here](https://nmrlipids.github.io/Databank/latest/). 
More information and example applications are available from the [NMRlipids databank manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45189-z).

The `DatabankLib` python module provides programmatic access to all simulation data in the 
NMRlipids Databank. It allows to request data to construct various datasets on the base of 
experimental and simulation data from the Databank that allow one to learn various models about 
lipid bilayer properties. It also allows to design and effectively run automated analysis across
all the simulations in the Databank.

## How to use 

A [jupyter template notebook](https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/blob/main/scripts/template.ipynb) can be used to get started with the analyses utilizing the NMRlipids databank.

Connection of [Universal molecule and atom naming conventions](https://nmrlipids.github.io/Databank/latest/schemas/moleculesAndMapping.html) with simulation specific names delivered by mapping files can be used to perform automatic analyses over large sets of simulations. The results for large analyses can be stored using the same structure as used for `README.yaml` files as done, for example, for [water permeation](https://github.com/NMRLipids/DataBankManuscript/tree/main/Data/MD-PERMEATION) and lipid [flip-flop](https://github.com/NMRLipids/DataBankManuscript/tree/main/Data/Flipflops) rates in the [repository related to the NMRlipids databank manuscript](https://github.com/NMRLipids/DataBankManuscript).

# Web UI

[NMRlipids Databank-webUI](https://databank.nmrlipids.fi/) provides an easy access to the NMRlipids Databank content. 
Simulations can be searched based on their molecular composition, force field,
temperature, membrane properties, and quality; the search results are ranked based on the simulation quality as evaluated
against experimental data when available. Web-UI provides basic graphical reports
for the computed properties as well as graphical comparison between simulation
and experimental data.

The Web-UI is being developed in the repository [BilayerGUI_laravel](https://github.com/NMRlipids/BilayerGUI_laravel).
