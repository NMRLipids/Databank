NMRlipids databank API functions
======================

The functions that help analyzing the data in NMRlipids databank are described here. These functions locate in `databanklibrary.py <https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank/blob/main/Scripts/BuildDatabank/databankLibrary.py>`_. To get started using these functions to analyse the NMRlipids databank, first create the folder where you want to work

.. code-block::

   mkdir NMRlipids/
   cd NMRlipids
   
then clone the NMRlipids databank git to this folder

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank.git

The minimun code to intialize NMRlipids databank is

.. code-block::

   import sys
   databankPath =  './Databank/'   # this is the local path for the cloned Databank git
   sys.path.insert(1, databankPath + '/Scripts/BuildDatabank/')
   from databankLibrary import * 
   systems = initialize_databank(databankPath)

After running this, the ``systems`` contains the list of dictionaries. Each dictionary is a simulation in the NMRlipids databank. These dictionaries can be then used to analyse properties from simulations. To loop over all simulations, run

.. code-block::

   for system in systems:
       print(system)
   
Examples on analyses over NMRlipids databank can be found from the `template <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/blob/main/scripts/template.ipynb>`_ and `codes used to analyze the results for the NMRlipids databank manuscript <https://github.com/NMRLipids/DataBankManuscript/tree/main/scripts>`_.
