Examples and tutorials
======================

A template project for analyses utilizing the NMRlipids databank is available in `here <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/tree/main>`_. The `scripts <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/tree/main/scripts>`_ folder contains examples and templates for analyses.

`Plotting basic simulation properties <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/blob/main/scripts/plotSimulation.ipynb>`_
----------------------------------
Plots the basic properties of simulation selected based on its NMRlipids databank ID number.

`Show ranking tables of simulations based in their quality against experimental data <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/blob/main/scripts/plotQuality.ipynb>`_
---------------
Shows different kinds of rankings of simulations against experimental data.

`Template for more advance API usage <https://github.com/NMRLipids/databank-template/blob/main/scripts/template.ipynb>`_
------------------
Demonstrates the usage of API by selecting a random simulation and performing analyses requiring atom names for the selected simulation.
